# High-frequency-macro-indicators
Track the changes in the macro environment through the study of simple changes in macro economic data releases. 
High Frequency Indicators process:
The goal of the high-frequency indicators is to provide a real-time snapshot of the economy by combining both lagging and leading indicators. We create indices for various sectors and conditions, including housing, business conditions, employment, profits, credit, consumer conditions, fiscal impulse, geopolitics, solvency, inflation, financial conditions, and market bubble risk. Each index is constructed as a rolling z-score, allowing us to measure how far the economy has deviated from its historical trends.
These indices are composed of sub-indices and market indicators. While most of the data is sourced from Bloomberg, some sub-indices, such as Geopolitics and the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, are derived from Haver Analytics. If a sub-index is not already stationary, we convert it into six-month moving changes to capture sudden economic shifts without introducing excessive noise. While the data is high-frequency, our approach ensures that we can still identify underlying trends.
To ensure consistency, certain sub-indices are inverted so that they align directionally with others. For instance, the unemployment rate is inverted to move in the same direction as employment growth. Once aligned, we calculate the z-scores for the sub-indices.
The headline high-frequency index is then computed as the equally weighted average of its sub-indices. Equal weighting is appealing due to its simplicity and its ability to reflect significant changes in sub-indices, regardless of their scale. Additionally, since the indices tend to move together over time, equal weighting helps balance the bias-variance tradeoff, improves robustness against overfitting, and enhances sensitivity to revisions.
Our DataFrames are structured to reflect daily changes, as some indicators, like PE ratios or credit spreads, are updated daily. However, other indicators, such as PMIs, are released monthly. To address this frequency mismatch, we hold the value of monthly indicators constant for all days within the given month. For example, if a PMI is released on October 1, that value is used for all days in October and updated only on November 1.
